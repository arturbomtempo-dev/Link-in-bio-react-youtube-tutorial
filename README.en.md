        Link in Bio
    </h1>
    <p align="center">
        This project was developed with the goal of teaching the basic concepts of TypeScript, React, and Styled Components in a practical and educational way. Created for a tutorial on YouTube, it demonstrates step-by-step how to build a Link in Bio, a page that centralizes and facilitates access to various important links, such as portfolio, social media, and contact. Inspired by tools like Linktree, this project offers a customizable and accessible solution for those who want to create their own link page, especially for Instagram.
